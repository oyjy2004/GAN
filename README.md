# GAN
This is a GAN that automatically generates anime face.  
The GAN is trained by the anime-fase-dataset which includes 60000+ animeface.  
Without GPU, the training process took a lot of time and the picture I generated may not be very good.  
You can found the dataset [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HG7YnakUkjaxtNMclbl2t5sJwGLcHYsI/view?usp=sharing](here).  
Below is the author of the dataset.
